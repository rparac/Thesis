Types of error
    Not sure if this is a mistake
         - The umpire ruled that the batter did not swing. - does not have "The umpire ruled". Not sure if this is a mistake. (+ 1 similar error)
         - The batter came around on his swing - missing "The batter came aruond on swing.". Not sure if this is a mistake.
         - This resulted in a foul ball - also has "This resulted". Arises from pobj 
         - A home run was hit out of the playing grounds. - Includes "out of the grounds" as well since playing is a amod.

    Parser errors causing problems
         - The ball was outside of the strike zone - has "The ball was" on its own. Parser error - the larger model has "outside" as advmod instead of prep.
         - The batter Atulve made contact with the pitch - poorly translated because of horrible dependency parse. Much better with larger model.
         - This makes it a foul ball - "This makes it a ball" incorrectly extracted. Parser considers it amod instead of compound like the larger parser.
         Maybe
         - The pitch was outside the strike zone - Returns "The pitch was" since outside is a part of pobj. (+1 similar error - It was outside the strike zone)

    Error which we may get away with:
         - The ball hit the ground before it was caught. - not have "The ball hit the ground". This is an adverbial clause. Might be handled by atomisation.

    Errors:
         - He was thrown out at first - missing "at first". The pcomp not in the solution
         - The player made contact hitting the ball back to the pitcher. - Missing "The player made contact". Looks like genuine error, might be learned as the example was broken.
         - The umpire called pitch a ball for being too high - missing full sentence. Genuine error (pcomp) not in the solution.
         - It crossed into foul territory before landing - doesn't deal with before landing
         - The batter connected with the ball - no acl
         - The ball did not appear to be in the strike zone from the angle. - "The ball did not appear from the angle" correct while we also include to be
         - It landed outside of the strike zone without being swung at by the batter. - Looks quite odd, there is no without. However, this example was broken before.
