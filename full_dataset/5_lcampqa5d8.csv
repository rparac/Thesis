Z676HXMH6JA2,out,It is a fly ball catch because there is a distinction between pop-up, in-field catch, and that to the far side of the out-field.  Note, it was easy to catch, so it is a pop-up versus a catch where the outfielder has to run to it

01PZJX4T77SY,ball,it went over the plate above the shoulders of the batter
IRMOK4IIL3OU,play,it was fielder's out as it was hit to the 3rd base who easily throws out. it is not a fielder's choice as he could not throw to second or first.  It is also a pseudo line-drive to third
